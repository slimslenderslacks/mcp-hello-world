# Hello World MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that provides web content fetching capabilities. This server enables LLMs to retrieve and process content from web pages, converting HTML to markdown for easier consumption.

The fetch tool will truncate the response, but by using the `start_index` argument, you can specify where to start the content extraction. This lets models read a webpage in chunks, until they find the information they need.

### Available Tools

- `fetch` - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.
    - `url` (string, required): URL to fetch
    - `max_length` (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return (default: 5000)
    - `start_index` (integer, optional): Start content from this character index (default: 0)
    - `raw` (boolean, optional): Get raw content without markdown conversion (default: false)

### Prompts

- **hello-world**
  - A simple tool that returns a greeting
  - Arguments:
    - `greeting` (string, required): the greeting to return 

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-fetch*.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-hello-world` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-hello-world
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_hello_world
```

## Configuration

### Configure for Claude.app

Add to your Claude settings:

<details>
<summary>Using docker</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "fetch": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--pull=always", "mcp/fetch"]
  }
}
```
</details>

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-fetch
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/fetch
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-fetch
```
